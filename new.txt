Slide 1:
HEADING: Understanding the Algorithm: The Recipe
CHUNK 1: Algorithms are precise, ordered sets of instructions.
CHUNK 2: They act as a digital recipe for solving specific problems logically.
CHUNK 3: Every task, from sorting data to running apps, requires an algorithm.
CHUNK 4: These instructions must be broken down into simple steps.

Slide 2:
HEADING: The Central Processing Unit at Work
CHUNK 1: The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is the machine’s primary execution unit.
CHUNK 2: It fetches, decodes, and executes algorithm instructions rapidly.
CHUNK 3: This instruction cycle operates millions of times every second.
CHUNK 4: This process ensures every instruction is followed exactly.

Slide 3:
HEADING: How Computers Use Simple Logic
CHUNK 1: All computer data relies on binary code (0s and 1s).
CHUNK 2: Computers use logic gates to interpret and manipulate these values.
CHUNK 3: These gates perform basic logical operations like AND, OR, and NOT.
CHUNK 4: This fundamental logic enables all complex computation.
